Dear W&M Students,

 

Due to the current power outage on campus, our Counseling Center phone lines are not working properly. Anyone needing to speak with someone in the Counseling Center at this time is encouraged to go in person to their offices on the 2nd floor of the McLeod Tyler Wellness Center.
