Helping you spot holiday scams and scammers
We’re here to help you protect yourself from scammers and avoid these scams. Share these tips with your loved ones and have safe, secure, and happy holidays.

Stay ahead of imposter scams
Scammers may pose as bank employees, utility companies, or online stores and pressure you to pay. Be wary of phone calls, texts, or emails that come out of the blue and don’t reply. Instead, reach out directly to your bank or the company to confirm the request.

Guard your information
Scammers might ask you to share passwords, one-time passcode, or account details — this is called “phishing.” We’ll never ask you for your confidential information. When in doubt — contact us directly.

Avoid anything too-good-to-be-true
Beware of scams that involve someone trying to sell you things you’ll never actually receive: concert tickets, pets, cryptocurrency, or jewelry that sound a little too good to be true.
Treat Zelle®1 like cash. Only send money to people or small businesses you know and trust because you can’t get those payments back.
