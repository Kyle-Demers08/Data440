Dear Tribe Student-Athletes,
 
I’m excited to share with you news about the expansion (link) of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) with the addition of Campbell University, effective July 1, 2023. With their addition, the CAA now has 14 full members.
 
This is a positive move for William & Mary and our fellow CAA members. With the ever-changing landscape of Division I athletics, it’s important that our conference remains strong and competitive as we build a framework of regional partners. As you know, earlier this year Hampton University, Monmouth University, Stony Brook University and North Carolina A&T State University accepted membership in our conference.

I will be meeting with all of our head coaches to discuss many conference-related issues, and I am sure that you have many of the same questions. As we finalize details about divisional play and championship field sizes, we will make them available to you.  
 
Please join me in welcoming the Fighting Camels to the CAA.
 
Go Tribe!
Brian D. Mann
Director of Athletics
