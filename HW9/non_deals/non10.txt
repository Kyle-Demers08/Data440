
Dear W&M Community,

Last February, William & Mary embarked on an ambitious strategic plan. Our Vision 2026 framework lays the foundation for W&M’s bold future. Over the next four years, we will launch key initiatives that address pressing global issues in arenas where we have competitive strength and opportunities to expand our reach. This is a plan that doubles down on what W&M does well.

Since Charter Day in February, our community has collaboratively refined that initial framework with concrete proposals that clarify how we will accomplish our vision. As we build together, ideas from across the university will continue to evolve and shape our plan between now and 2026 — the quarter millennium of our nation. 

As promised, each semester, I will report on W&M’s progress and celebrate our achievements. Today’s email begins these regular correspondences. Additionally, the Vision 2026 website will be updated periodically with stories, videos and highlights.

Below my signature, you will find updates on our four cross-cutting initiatives. I am grateful for the generative proposals that faculty and staff are pursuing in these multidisciplinary areas. This kind of innovative thinking — for three centuries a part of W&M’s ethos — positions our university to be the best in the world in these critical areas.
