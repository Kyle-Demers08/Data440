We would love your help in spreading joy this holiday season by providing presents for those in need.  Each of our locations has a tree with tags listing presents needed for students in the Virginia beach area.  All gifts must be returned by December 12. Let's make it a little more joyous for those families who are in need these holidays.

Direct Sports Performance:

The Safety In Strength 

 

At DIrect Sports Performance we pride ourselves on creating a safe strength training environment for your athletes.  Too often I hear about young athletes being overloaded or taught that proper lifting technique isn’t the most important part of strength training.  When athletes are overloaded at a young age we not only put them at risk of injury but we create bad habits that those athletes can take with them for the rest of their lives.  At DSP we pride ourselves on creating strength training habits that will not only enhance your athlete’s performance but help them create habits that will aid their fitness for the rest of their lives.
