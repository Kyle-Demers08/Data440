Happy *almost* Thanksgiving break, Class of 2023! 



I hope you're hanging in there, as always, Iâ€™m sending you positive vibes, and a happy daylight savings. Feel free to stop me in public if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or just feel like ranting. I'd be happy to help in any way I can. You can also shoot me a quick email (contact information at the end of this email) if that's more your style. Please remember that myself and the other senators are here as a resource for you. Below I've included some helpful links, reminders, and announcements. 


Consider Donating to the Senior Class Gift 

Donations can be made to any department, student club, or area on campus that has positively impacted your time at W&M. Any contribution counts, but seniors that donate $20.23 will receive the senior mug which can be used for discounts at eight different Williamsburg businesses across campus. Seniors that donate any amount will also be invited to exclusive donor appreciation events like Wine & Cheese night in the Spring. Seniors can pick up or purchase their mugs at the Sadler Terrace during Impact Week (Nov 14-18) from 11:00 - 2:00 pm each day
