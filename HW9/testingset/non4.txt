Good morning,

 

I am reaching out regarding important updates to the spring 2023 registration process.

 

More seats and sections: The Arts & Sciences dean’s office is working with faculty to add more seats to our COLL 100s and COLL 150s and more sections of high demand courses. To allow students the ability to focus on finals without double checking Banner, those changes will not be made until Wednesday, December 21st. As a reminder, the current registration window is open until Sunday, January 8th.
Pause on overrides: In coordination with the University Registrar’s Office, we are turning off maximum capacity overrides until December 21st to ensure a smooth process for course enrollment adjustments. During the next two weeks, we ask you to hold off an any max capacity override requests until we are able to make scheduled adjustments.
