Hey Kyle, 

Just wanted to send a little reminder that our 30% off EVERYTHING sale is happening now, but this sale won’t last forever! Plus, take an extra 50% off markdowns. Make sure you get the pieces you want NOW before it’s too late. Use code BF30 at checkout to receive your 30% off.

And did you know that today is Giving Tuesday, a global generosity movement of giving back!?

Today in our continued effort to support families in need, we are donating clothes to Baby2Baby; a non-profit organization that provides children living in poverty with diapers, clothing and all the basic necessities that every child deserves.

This year we’re proud to have donated over 1 million dollars worth of clothes to Baby2Baby. As an official certified B Corp, we’re committed to a higher standard for ourselves, our community, and our planet.

Happy Shopping!

Haley
