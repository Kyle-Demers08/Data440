## Discussion

I am familiar using markdown in the jupyter hub. I used Dillinger just to get some experience with another way to use markdown. It is all the same, but all my school files are in jupyter so I will likely continue to use that. The image tripped me up for a little bit, but after creating a md in github, I was able to just copy and paste my image url and that worked. I couldn't get my picture to be a local file in Dillinger, so this was the solution I came up with.
