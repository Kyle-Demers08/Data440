Homework 6 - Creating (good) social bots
Due: Tuesday, November 22, 2022 by 11:59pm Read through the entire assignment before starting. Do not wait until the last minute to start working on it.

Assignment
Social bots have been used to inflate the popularity of political candidates, influence public opinion through the spread of disinformation and conspiracy theories, and manipulate stock prices through coordinated campaigns. The threats posed by malicious actors that utilize social bots are far-reaching, endangering democracy, public health, and the economy.

However, not all bots are bad. In this assignment you will prove this point by creating a (good) Twitter bot. You will NOT be scored on the complexity or sophistication of the Twitter bot, instead, you will be scored on the usefulness and originality/innovation of the bot.

Your Twitter bot must post tweets on a special Twitter account created by you.

Write a report that contains the answers and explains how you arrived at the answers to the following questions. Before starting, review the HW report guidelines. Name your report for this assignment hw6_report with the proper file extension.

(Report (2 points)

Criteria 1. Usefulness (4 points)
Consider creating a bot to solve or partly solve a problem you care about --- maybe not poverty or crime or income inequality. In other words create a tool to address a need. Provide an argument in your report for the reason your Twitter bot is useful.

## Answer

The Qatar world cup is my no means controversial, but aside from the huge human rights issues, the timeframe has caused many problems. 
Since the world cup is in the middle of club season as opposed to a break at the end of the club season, many injuries are occuring.
It's important to know when big name players of countries are missing from the starting squad. This way when the starting lineups are out, you aren't shocked when someone is missing due to injury.
There are 68 world cup games and most people don't have time to watch every single one. 
The highlights also don't show injuries. 
My bot intends to post when players get subbed off due to injury, and ?if they get injuried during training?
This bot could be useful for sports betters, or just for soccer enthusiasts.


Criteria 2. Originality/Innovation (4 points)
Express yourself, be creative. Alternatively, consider improving a pre-existing solution or tool. Provide an argument in your report for the reason your Twitter bot is original or innovative.
