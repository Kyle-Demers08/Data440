## Homework 6 - Creating (good) social bots

## Assignment
Social bots have been used to inflate the popularity of political candidates, influence public opinion through the spread of disinformation and conspiracy theories, and manipulate stock prices through coordinated campaigns. The threats posed by malicious actors that utilize social bots are far-reaching, endangering democracy, public health, and the economy.

However, not all bots are bad. In this assignment you will prove this point by creating a (good) Twitter bot. You will NOT be scored on the complexity or sophistication of the Twitter bot, instead, you will be scored on the usefulness and originality/innovation of the bot.

Write a report that contains the answers and explains how you arrived at the answers to the following questions. Before starting, review the HW report guidelines. Name your report for this assignment hw6_report with the proper file extension.

## Criteria 1. Usefulness 
Consider creating a bot to solve or partly solve a problem you care about --- maybe not poverty or crime or income inequality. In other words create a tool to address a need. Provide an argument in your report for the reason your Twitter bot is useful.

## Answer

Christmas is coming up and it's important not to let it sneak up on you. 
It's also important to get on Santa's nice list. That means people should be doing good deeds. 
My bot intends to serve as a Christmas countdown as well as provide good deeds to do. 
The bot will post twice a day for two reminders as well as two seperate good deeds. 
This is an important bot to have so that you don't forget to buy presents for loved ones, you do good things, and the holiday joy is being spread.
On Christmas Eve and Christmas, the bot has special messages for tuning in.

### Discussion

I initially wanted to make my bot about injuries in the FIFA World Cup, but couldn't find a way to consistently get it right.

This was my original answer:
The Qatar world cup is my no means controversial, but aside from the huge human rights issues, the timeframe has caused many problems. 
Since the world cup is in the middle of club season as opposed to a break at the end of the club season, many injuries are occuring.
It's important to know when big name players of countries are missing from the starting squad. This way when the starting lineups are out, you aren't shocked when someone is missing due to injury.
There are 64 world cup games and most people don't have time to watch every single one. 
My bot intends to post when players get subbed off due to injury, or if they get injuried during training.
This bot could be useful for sports betters, or just for soccer enthusiasts.

### Criteria 2. Originality/Innovation (4 points)
Express yourself, be creative. Alternatively, consider improving a pre-existing solution or tool. Provide an argument in your report for the reason your Twitter bot is original or innovative.

Countdowns to large events aren't a new thing. You can google days till christmas and find that whenever you'd like.
The reason this bot is great is because it gets you thinking about christmas every day. This way Christmas won't sneak up on you.
This bot is also original in the sense that it gives you a good deed to do as well as counts down towards Christmas. 
The bot is great for all ages, younger kids to get excited for Christmas, middling teens to do good things, and adults to be prepared for the Holiday.
It's an innovative idea as this is an automated way to do something that if it were to be done, it would be by a human doing a tedious task.
